# Mapping Earthquakes

## Summary

The purpose of this project was to visualize earthquake data for the past seven days via a browser. This was accomplished by utilizing JS to access and US Geological Survey data. Using Leaflet, the data was mapped for visualization purposes, wherein users may quickly determine the magnitude of the earthquare via the size and color of its marker. Furthermore, faultlines were visualized on the map in order to give users information regarding the magnitude and location of an earthquake relative to the nearest faultline. 

Lastly, major earthquakes were mapped separately (i.e. earthquakes with a magnitude of greater than 4.0).
